# Event-registration-app
In this project, I am going to build an Event Registration app while learning the following concepts:

1. Writing ES6 modules
2. Form validation with JavaScript
3. Working with dynamic data (data loaded from the server)
4. Making AJAX requests using fetch
5. Working with asynchronous functions using Promises
6. Creating charts using Chart.js

The scenario for my project:

I am organizing a JavaScript meetup in my locality. I have invited people from schools, colleges, and offices, who are all interested in JavaScript. I need to create a website for attendees to register for the event. 
The website should have the following functionalities:

A form to help users register for the event.
A page that shows statistics on the number of users interested in the event as a chart.
An about page with event details and the location of the event embedded as a Google Map.
Also, most of the people will be using mobile phones to register for the event. 
So, the application should be fully responsive.
